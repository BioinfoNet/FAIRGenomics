# FAIR Genomics

Welcome!! Karibu!!

The goal of this project is to promote FAIR genomic data.

As genomic research data generated in Africa grows, there is a need to adopt open science practices and policies in data storage, reuse, reproducible pipelines and collaborative research. The big genomic data generating consortia, like H3Africa, have data storage and reuse policies but the data generated in small projects by individual researchers are not supported, especialy in resource limitted settings. From our research, during the OpenScienceKE hackathon, it was clear that the majority of institutions in Kenya do not have genomic data management and sharing policies. We seek to adopt appropriate genomic data reuse policies and frameworks, and promote their adaptation in in Kenya. The goal is to promote FAIR genomic data.
 
Moreover, genomic analysis, especially in Africa, needs to attract computer and data scientists, who are leaders in data storage, and experts in machine learning. To enhance the diffusion of machine learning (ML) technologies to biomedical research, I propose collaborative projects with CS utilising ML in genomic analysis. I will also leverage the CS community to adapt genomic storage frameworks, by information system students, and infrastructure, by CS students.

The expected outcome of this project is growth in FAIR genomic data storage policies and frameworks, enhanced collaboration between computer and biomedical scientist, and increased uptake of machine learning for genomic analysis. Ultimately, we aim to grow OpenScienceKE, a community of scientists, researchers and students seeking to promote open science practices in Kenya. 


## Who are we?
A group of researchers, scientists, and students led by Caleb Kibet, interested in FAIR Genomics, and in ading value to data through reuse.
